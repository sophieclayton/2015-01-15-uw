<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>
  <a href="//software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help researchers become more productive
  by teaching them basic lab skills for computing.
  This two-day hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools;
  participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. 
  The goal of the workshop is for participants to acquire skills to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>enable automation of repetitive tasks</li>
<li>work with structured data</li>
<li>improve the reproducibility of your research</li>
<li>version control code for reuse and collaboration.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>
  This workshop is supported by the UW <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/">
  eScience Institute</a>. Priority will thus be given to UW-affiliated students, 
  staff and faculty.
</p>

<p>
Please use the Etherpads (<a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/2015-01-15-uw-r">R room pad</a>, <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/2015-01-15-uw-py">Python room pad</a>) and the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23swc-uw">#swc-uw</a> hashtag on Twitter during class. We have a <a href="http://lists.software-carpentry.org/mailman/listinfo/seattle_lists.software-carpentry.org">UW Software Carpentry email list</a> that you can join to keep up with local plans, to get advice, ask questions, etc. after the workshop is over.

    In particular, if it is only open to people from a particular institution,
    or if specialized prerequisite knowledge is required, please mention that.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students, staff, faculty and other 
  researchers at UW. No previous experience with programming is required. If
  you do have experience in the topics in the syllabus and want to help,

<!--

-->
<p>
  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
  Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages 
  installed in advance (<a href="#Setup">listed below</a>). They are also required to abide by Software Carpentry's
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<p>
We find that workshops go a lot better if people come in groups, e.g., 
4-5 people from one lab, half a dozen from another department or 
institute, etc., so that they are less inhibited about asking 
questions, and can support each other afterwards. So while individual 
sign-ups are welcome, we encourage you to sign-up with a friend.
</p>

<p>
No previous programming skills or experience is required. The lesson 
contents and exercises are aimed at novices.

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>
  We are running two full concurrent sessions, one in each room. There 
  are two key differences between the sessions. First is that one session
  will teach programming with <b>Python</b> and the other session will teach programming 
  with <b>R</b>, all the other class content will be the same. <br><br>
  As a rough guide to choosing which language to learn, Python might be best for you if you're working in the   
  natural or physical sciences, and if you're in the social sciences and humanities then 
  R might be more valuable. <br><br>
  The second difference between the two sessions is that the instructors 
  in the Python session mostly come from the natural and physical sciences, 
  while the instructors in the R session mostly come from the social sciences 
  and humanities. These is simply a convenient way to organise the lessons, 
  and of course you're welcome to join whichever session you think will 
  benefit you the most. The choice is completely up to you.
